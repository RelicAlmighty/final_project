            <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, and welcome to Method Meister! I am Thomas Agulto, and I currently hold a 1st degree black belt in
                Taekwondo. If you are wondering, I have been in Taekwondo for over 3 years. It took me countless tests,
                practicing, and memorizing to get the rank I currently hold. Taekwondo is not the only martial art I
                practice; I practice Muay Thai and Jiu Jitsu on my free days. Over Gualo Rai, Saipan, I help my uncle
                run the Camacho Taekwondo dojo right beside Rocksteady. There are currently two sessions, and my brother
                and instruct and supervise both classes. Although I am an instructor, I am not able to teach on my own.
                With the supervision of my master, and uncle, I am able to give classes and be corrected all while
                learning new techniques that will help me in the future.</p>

            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>The reason for this website is to explain what martial arts is, its purpose, and that all martial arts
                are not taught the same way. The belt ranking systems are set with requirements for each student to
                achieve, not to show how skilled each person is at fighting. Black belt ranks are not just the highest
                rank a person can achieve, but it is also a milestone and proof of hardwork and dedication an individual
                has given to the art they practice.</p>

            <h2>Belt Ranking System</h2>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="images/belts.jpg" alt="belt ranks" class="belts">
            </div>
            <p>Be aware, the belt ranking system is put in place to let others know how long each student has been
                practicing. The belt rank does not
                define the combat skill an individual has. Each
                belt color determines a student's experience and amount of training they have accumulated. The belt
                color also helps the master find the right training intensity and required skills for each student.
                Another good example of what belt colors are used for is to determine the tasks that each student is
                able to do. Not all white belts are skilled enough to perform such difficult movements, such as, a
                jumping-reverse kick. Lastly, the belt ranking systems vary for each school and their affiliated martial
                arts style. Each instructor has a different requirement for each belt color to be achieved. For more

            <h2>What is a Black Belt?</h2>
            <div class="image">
                <figcaption>Hover over me</figcaption>
                <img src="images/black-belt.jpg" alt="black belt" class="black-belt">
            </div>
            <p>A black belt is a distinguised rank that signifies the time and dedication an individual has put into the
                martial art they practice. One common stereotype is that black belts are dangerous, intimidating, and
                are most likely unbeatable. As a black belt, I can confirm that these stereotypes are very untrue. Most
                of the black belts I meet are kind, calm, and have a good attitude. Us black belts are almost always the
                janitors of the dojo. The reason
                we are told to clean up after the class is to remind ourselves that although we hold high ranks, we are
                still not as high as our master and need our master to guide us further. </p>

            <h2>The Purpose of Martial Arts</h2>
            <p>Martial arts was not meant to inflict such damage, rather, it is a way to defend oneself without harming
                the opponent or aggressor. Overpowering the aggressor or opponent is the goal of winning a fight.
                Martial arts is a way to help maintain self-control and to deescalate a situation first and use
                self-defense techniques last. Most
                hollywood films portay martial arts as a violent way of hurting or killing someone to get what they
                want. It should be used as a last resort when it comes to defending oneself. Selling martial arts as a
                practice of looking invincible and gaining the upper-hand in any fight will spread more violence than
                peace.</p>

            <h2>A Real Altercation vs. A Controlled Altercation </h2>
            <p>A person that has trained in a controlled environment will not expect the same situation outside of the
                their training grounds. If a trained practitioner were to apply what they learned in a street
                altercation, they would find it difficult. One of the main reasons why it is difficult to apply the
                knowledge in a street altercation is the aggressors are not motionless. Additionally, the aggressors or
                opponents are not trained and have an awkward fighting style. A street altercation does not have rubber
                floor paddings or protective gear.</p>

            <h2>Self-Defense is not a Combat Sport</h2>
            <p>When taking a self-defense class, the techniques are set to buy enough time to prevent yourself from
                being harmed and to get as far as possible from the aggressor. A combat sport allows the students to not
                just defend themselves, but to
                also engage in a fight that lasts longer than a self-defense technique. One good example of combat
                sports is mixed-martial arts. This type of martial art combines multiple art forms and applies each
                technique that actually works on unorthodoxed aggressors. The video below best explains the two and what
                their purposes are.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Finding the Ideal School for You</h2>
            <p>Before joining a martial arts school, it is recommended to do some research beforehand so that you can
                get a heads-up on what to expect. There are no schools that are the same because each instructor has a
                different way of teaching a martial art. Some can sell their martial art as a way to look invincible
                while some care more about money, which is why some prices are high and some classes offer more belt
                colors than usual. A tip to ensuring the instructor is legit is to ask for proof of their certification
                to see where they got their certifcation, when, and which martial art association they affiliate
                themselves with. One of the most common, but not so reliable, way of knowing which master or
                instructoris the best based on their body structure. I am not body shaming anyone, but having a smaller
                built intstructor is best. The reason is that they use their size to their advantage and not heavily
                relying on strength like most instructors that have muscular body. To get an in depth explanation, you
                can visit <a

            <h2>In Summary</h2>
            <p>In short, the belt color of an individual does not determine the capabilities of a person under any
                circumstances. Although trained for years, martial artists are limited to what they can do. How an
                instructor performs or runs a class will reflect on the students, so it is recommended to be careful
                when choosing a school and to do as much research as possible. The best way
                to avoid violence is simply to not be part of one and to not engage ourselves in any violence. Even the
                most skilled artists see defeat.</p>
