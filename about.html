            <p>I am Thomas Agulto and I currently attend the Northern Marianas College as a student, and work-study. My
                Taekwondo journey started in my Master's garden during the Covid-19 lockdown. After about 2 months of
                training in the garden, I was finally brought into the dojo to train and was rewarded with my first rank
                of white belt. Through the course of a year, I was able to reach the last colored belt, known in Korean
                as "Gup" or 2nd Gup
                which is the red colored belt. I forgot to mention that my brother was part of the journey. We did not
                outrank each other because we both wanted the same thing - achieve the black belt together.</p>

            <h2>Camacho Taekwondo</h2>
            <div class="image">

            </div>
            <p>The Camacho Taekwondo is focused mainly on <strong>balance</strong> and <strong>coordination</strong>
                which in turn generates confidence. The Camacho Taekwondo has been in business for more than 10 years
                and is lead by none other than Congressman Vicente Camacho. Master Camacho has been practicing
                taekwondo for 45 years and has been teaching for over 25 years. He holds a 5th degree black belt and is
                certified under the World Taekwondo Federation.
            </p>

            <h2>Types of Training</h2>
            <p>The most common type of training done in the dojo would be <strong>peer instruction</strong>. This allows
                colored belts to either help or to teach the new students what to do in the absence of our master or
                senior ranking students or instructors. My brother and I have both started off with peer instruction
                before becoming assistant instructors.</p>

            <p>Another kind of training is the <strong>balance</strong> training. We typically learn kicks on a flat
                surface. The
                best way to test our ability to balance is with the use of the balance beam. We are instructed to
                perform the kicks while walking on a beam similar to the ones that gymnasts use. This helps us to
                distribute our weight and execute the kicks properly.</p>

            <p>Another training that was recently introduced to taekwondo as a whole is the use of the <strong>wooden
                    staff</strong> (or
                stick). This is a common tool is used by most martial arts to defend oneself with. We use the staff to
                perform attacks and forms, which will be discussed in the next paragraph. </p>

            <p><strong>Forms</strong>, also known in Korean as "taegeuk" is a drill of techniques that can be used as a
                tool of
                self-defense. The forms involve multiple blocks and can help with balance and coordination. The forms
                are performed in a cross, turning left and right four consecutive times before transitioning to the next
                set of blocks. This is a pattern of defense
                that each student can use when in danger or feeling threatened by an aggressor.</p>

            <p>Another training would be the <strong>self-defense drills</strong>. The drils involve a series of
                stand-up defense
                techniques that can stun then opponent and cause them to fall. These techniques does not require a whole
                bunch of stength, rather, momentum and wrist control to gain the advantage in any altercation with the
                element of surprise.</p>

            <p>And lastly, one of the many trainings is the <strong>hand-to-hand combat</strong>. This type of training
                allows for all students to have some way of defending themselves if cornered by an aggressor. The types
                of hand-to-hand combat include effective take-downs and body shots that can hurt or stun the aggressor.
                One of my favorite hand-to-hand combat defense drills would be what we call <cite>"the bear hug"</cite>.
                The bear hug is when an aggressor grabs the torso fom behind and is acted upon with the defender
                shrugging their shoulds, throwing an elbow to the rib, and grabbing the aggressor's arm and throwing
                them forward using momentum generated from the hips alone.</p>
